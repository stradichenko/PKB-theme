- Sufficient storage for product images and media

### Security Best Practices

5. **Security Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and malware
6. **Web Application Firewall**: Implement WAF protection

### Performance Optimization

## Conclusion

Self-hosted ecommerce solutions offer freedom, flexibility, and full control over your online store. While they require more technical knowledge than hosted solutions, the benefits of ownership and customization make them ideal for businesses seeking independence from platform restrictions and fees.

While self-hosted solutions offer freedom from subscription fees, remember to account for potential costs from premium extensions, development resources, and third-party services. Many open-source platforms operate on a freemium model where the core is free, but advanced features require purchasing extensions or upgrading to commercial editions.

Choose a solution that not only meets your current needs but also aligns with your long-term budget and technical capabilities.
