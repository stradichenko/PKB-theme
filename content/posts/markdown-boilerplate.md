This document demonstrates all standard Markdown features along with proper sidenote usage. This resource is the central reference for all content creators building a [Digital Garden](/posts/digital-garden/) or implementing the [Zettelkasten Method](/posts/zettelkasten-method/).

## Basic Typography

Effective typography forms the foundation of digital writing. As explained in our [Hugo Styling Guide](/posts/hugo-styling-guide/), consistent formatting improves readability. This is especially important when [organizing content](/posts/content-organization/) in your knowledge base.

Sidenotes work great with lists to provide additional context for specific items without breaking the list flow. {{< cite "smith2020" "/bibtex/references.bib" "apa" "true" >}}

**Bold text** and *italic text* are straightforward. You can also have ***bold italic text*** and ~~strikethrough~~. {{< sidenote >}} 
**Sidenotes can contain formatting too!** Use them for supplementary information that doesn't interrupt the main text flow. 
{{< /sidenote >}}

Plain text with a sidenote. {{< sidenote >}}
This is a standard sidenote. Use it for brief asides or clarifications.
{{< /sidenote >}}


For academic applications of these formatting techniques, see our [Academic Writing](/posts/academic-writing/) guide. {{< cite "johnson2019" "/bibtex/references.bib" "apa" "true" >}}

## Headings

Above was an H2. Here are other levels, crucial for [content organization](/posts/content-organization/):

### H3 Heading

#### H4 Heading

##### H5 Heading

###### H6 Heading

## Lists

Lists are essential for structuring information in your [Personal Knowledge Base](/posts/personal-knowledge-base/).

### Unordered Lists

- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item a
  - Nested item b
- Item three

{{< sidenote >}}
Sidenotes work great with lists to provide additional context for specific items without breaking the list flow.
{{< /sidenote >}}

### Ordered Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Nested item 1
   2. Nested item 2
3. Third item

### Task Lists

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [ ] Another task

## Links and Images

[External link](https://example.com) and [internal link](../another-post/)

![Image alt text](https://via.placeholder.com/150 "Image Title")

{{< sidenote >}}
Images can be further explained here without cluttering the main content.
{{< /sidenote >}}

## Code

Inline `code` is wrapped with backticks.

```python
# Code block with syntax highlighting
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

{{< sidenote >}}
Code explanations can be placed in sidenotes, keeping the code block clean while providing context.
{{< /sidenote >}}

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> It can span multiple lines.

{{< sidenote >}}
Provide information about the quote source or additional context here.
{{< /sidenote >}}

## Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

## Horizontal Rule

## Advanced Sidenote Usage

Plain text with a sidenote. {{< sidenote >}}
This is a standard sidenote. Use it for brief asides or clarifications.
{{< /sidenote >}}

Complex paragraph with multiple concepts that benefit from sidenotes.{{< sidenote >}}
First sidenote explaining an initial concept in detail without interrupting the paragraph flow.
{{< /sidenote >}} The text continues here with more information that might need explanation.{{< sidenote >}}
Second sidenote providing additional context or examples for another concept mentioned in the same paragraph.
{{< /sidenote >}}

### Sidenotes with References

Academic-style writing often uses sidenotes for citations.ยน{{< sidenote >}}
ยน Author, N. (2023). Title of the work. Publisher. Page 42.
{{< /sidenote >}}

## Math Expressions

This theme supports mathematical expressions using KaTeX/MathJax rendering.

### Inline Math

Inline math is wrapped in single dollar signs: $E = mc^2$, $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$, $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$

{{< sidenote >}}
Inline math integrates seamlessly with your text flow for simple expressions and variables.
{{< /sidenote >}}

### Block Math

For standalone equations, use double dollar signs:

$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

### Equation Arrays and Alignment

For multiple aligned equations:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x) &= (a+b)^2 \\
&= a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\end{align}
$$

### Matrices

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
ax + by \\
cx + dy
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Complex Notation

$$
\iiint_V \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{v} = \oiint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S}
$$

{{< sidenote >}}
The above is Gauss's divergence theorem, showing volume integrals can be converted to surface integrals. Complex mathematical expressions benefit from sidenotes that explain the concepts without cluttering the formula.
{{< /sidenote >}}

### Numbered Equations

$$
\tag{1} E = mc^2
$$

### Chemical Equations

$$
\ce{H2O + CO2 -> H2CO3}
$$

## Footnotes

Standard markdown footnotes[^1] work like this.

[^1]: This is a footnote content.

## HTML in Markdown

<div style="color: blue;">
  Custom HTML can be included directly in markdown files if your renderer supports it.
</div>

## Conclusion

This boilerplate demonstrates the range of markdown features and proper sidenote usage. Copy, adapt, and extend for your own documents.
