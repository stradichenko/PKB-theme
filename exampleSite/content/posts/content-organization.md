# Content Organization Guide

Effective content organization is crucial for any knowledge management system. This guide covers best practices for structuring your digital content. For proper formatting of all elements in this guide, refer to our comprehensive [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/).

## Hierarchical vs. Network Organization

Traditional organization is hierarchical (folders and subfolders), but knowledge bases benefit from a network approach with bidirectional links. See our [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/) for examples of proper linking syntax.

{{< sidenote >}} 
Hierarchies work well for archiving, while networks excel at discovery and connection-making. {{< /sidenote >}}

For practical implementation in a PKB, see our [Personal Knowledge Base Guide](/posts/personal-knowledge-base/). All content should follow the formatting conventions in our [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/).

## Taxonomies in Hugo

Hugo offers powerful taxonomy capabilities, which can enhance your [Digital Garden](/posts/digital-garden/) implementation:

```toml
[taxonomies]
  category = "categories"
  tag = "tags"
  series = "series"
  feature = "features"
```

Proper formatting is essential when working with taxonomiesâ€”see our [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/) for complete syntax guidelines.

## PARA Method

The PARA method organizes content into four categories, as explained in our [Zettelkasten Method](/posts/zettelkasten-method/) comparison:

1. **Projects** - Active with deadlines
2. **Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities
3. **Resources** - Topics of interest
4. **Archives** - Inactive items

This system pairs well with [Digital Garden](/posts/digital-garden/) approaches. For consistent formatting across all these types, refer to our [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/).

## Progressive Summarization

Developed by Tiago Forte, progressive summarization involves layering highlights to distill content:

- Layer 1: Full content
- Layer 2: Bold important points (format using techniques from our [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/))
- Layer 3: Highlight within the bold
- Layer 4: Executive summary

This approach complements the methods discussed in our [Academic Writing](/posts/academic-writing/) guide.

## Implementing in Hugo

Hugo's content organization features include:

- Front matter for metadata (see examples in our [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/))
- Content types
- Page bundles
- Sections and taxonomies

For styling your organized content, see our [Hugo Styling Guide](/posts/hugo-styling-guide/), which builds on the formatting standards in our [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/).

## Conclusion

Good organization balances structure with flexibility. Experiment with different systems and adapt what works best for your thinking style and content needs. For all your content formatting needs, our [Markdown Boilerplate](/posts/markdown-boilerplate/) remains the definitive reference.
