# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten method is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management system developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann.

## What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a method that emphasizes:

1. Atomic notes (one idea per note)
2. Explicit connections between notes
3. Emergent structure through links

For formatting your Zettelkasten notes, see our [Markdown reference](/posts/post-1/).

Luhmann produced over 70 books and 400 scholarly articles, attributing his productivity to his Zettelkasten system.

## Core Principles

### Atomic Notes

Each note should contain exactly one idea, making it easier to connect and recombine.

### Connection-First Thinking

The value lies not in individual notes but in their connections. For a broader approach to connection-based systems, see our [Digital Garden Guide](/posts/digital-garden/).

### Your Own Words

Notes should be written in your own words to ensure understanding and integration with your knowledge.

## Implementation in a PKB

Implementing Zettelkasten in a personal knowledge base requires:

1. A consistent note format
2. A reliable linking system
3. A method for discovering connections

Read our [Personal Knowledge Base Guide](/posts/personal-knowledge-base/) for integration strategies.

## Zettelkasten vs. Other Methods

Several modern tools support the Zettelkasten method:

- Obsidian
- Roam Research
- Zettlr
- The Archive
- Hugo with custom templates
